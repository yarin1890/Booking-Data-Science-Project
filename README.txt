First upload of the Booking Data Science project created by me and Chai Halfon.

In this project, we've crawled through Booking's website, downloaded thousands of hotels information from Eilat, Israel.
Afterwards, we created graphs and visualizations for understanding the average of available rooms per month,
according to different hotel's properties, and which month is the most expensive.
Then, we used the sklearn package created in Python for using machine learning functions on our data, to try and predict 
the number of available rooms each month, according to different properties.
