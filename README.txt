First upload of the Booking Data Science project created by me and Chai Halfon.

In this project, we've crawled through Booking's website, and imported thousands of hotels information from Eilat, Israel into dataframes.
Afterwards, we created graphs and visualizations for understanding the average of available rooms per month,
according to different hotel's properties, and to try and understand which month is the most expensive as well.
Then, we used the sklearn package created in Python for using machine learning functions on our data, to try and predict 
the number of available rooms each month, according to different properties.
